00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
each other and run the applications together. So they're computers on a

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,640
network on an internal network connected to each other and they handle different

3
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:17,360
portions of the load. So this way we can simply scale up if we get more and more

4
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:31,360
requests then we can simply add more computers to our distributed system.


1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,240
there is another massive advantage to this approach is that let's say that we

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:11,480
have one of these services running and it gets a lot of requests suddenly one

3
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:17,720
of these computers stops working what's gonna happen is all these other ones

4
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:23,140
automatically will find out that this computer is not active anymore so they

5
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:30,120
handle that the...
